This document summarizes notable issues found in the current `pylibremetaverse` codebase.

General observations
--------------------
* Many manager classes are present only as stubs with `pass` bodies. Examples include
  `InventoryAISClient`, `GridManager`, `DirectoryManager`, `EstateTools`, `TerrainManager`,
  `AvatarManager`, `SoundManager`, and `AgentThrottle`.
* The HTTP capabilities client (`network/http_caps_client.py`) does not implement any
  real functionality beyond placeholders.
* Several utilities (e.g. zero‐coding in `utils/helpers.py`, bit packing helpers)
  contain TODO comments and are only partially implemented.
* The login response class (`network/login_defs.LoginResponseData`) lacks XML‑RPC
  parsing support (`parse_xmlrpc` is a stub).
* Tests do not currently pass (`test_login_parses_response` fails due to missing
  `requests` attribute), indicating incomplete test coverage.

Syntax errors detected by Pyflakes
----------------------------------
Running `pyflakes pylibremetaverse` surfaces numerous syntax errors which prevent
execution of the code. Selected examples include:
* `types/primitive.py`: missing indented block after `if` at line 261.
* `types/custom_uuid.py`: invalid syntax around commented C# members.
* `network/packets_agent.py`: malformed class definition causing invalid syntax.
* `assets/asset_wearable.py`: unmatched parenthesis at line 100.
* `managers/inventory_manager.py`: invalid syntax near line 667.
* `managers/agent_manager.py`: long one‑line method definitions leading to
  syntax errors at line 134.
* `managers/object_manager.py`: invalid syntax around a `for` loop at line 90.
* `managers/asset_manager.py`: unterminated string literal at line 478.
* `network/packets_teleport.py`: several undefined names referencing `dataclasses`.

Unused imports and variables are also widespread throughout the package.
See `/tmp/pyflakes.log` for the full output (~100 lines) containing additional
warnings.

Missing implementations
-----------------------
* Various network packet types are only partially defined or refer to undefined
  classes. For instance, teleport and appearance packet handling references
  `Vector3` and `List` which are not imported.
* Parsing of zero‑coded packets is only partially implemented in
  `utils/helpers.py` and lacks proper compression/decompression logic.
* Some packet handlers (e.g. in `object_manager`, `agent_movement`) appear
  incomplete or have placeholder logic.
* The C# port left comments and sections that reference features not yet
  translated to Python (e.g. TODOs in `appearance_manager` for texture handling).

Overall, the library requires extensive cleanup:
* Resolve syntax errors preventing module import.
* Remove or implement placeholder `pass` sections for the various manager
  classes.
* Complete packet parsing logic and correct undefined references.
* Finish utility functions (zero‑coding, bit packing) and implement missing
  login parsing features.
